These are just some really simple websites to help me practice/reinforce my programming learning.  They consist of a small suite of apps to make my day-job a bit easier and a personal blog documenting my progress with programming.  I'm using Flask as a framework.

Combined my CS Tools and personal blog websites to more easily manage them through Git.
