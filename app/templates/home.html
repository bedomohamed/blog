    It was quite an eventful weekend.  Kerry was out of town so I had plenty of time to really dive into my next
    project.  It was a whole lot of feeling overwhelmed and gradual understanding, and I came out the other side with a
    couple of usable apps.  Check the project page or my ongoing <a href="#" style="color: #FFCC00">writeup</a> for more details.

    Obviously design is not a strength of mine at the moment.  This thing is very Geocities, but it works.
    Just learning how to get a website together with Python and Flask and getting it to actually be on the internet somewhere
    has been very educational.  I'm using what I'm learning to cobble together a suite of extremely simple web apps to
    (hopefully) make a few things at work a bit easier or faster.  I have two in mind right now: a template using HTML
    forms and Python to draft a boilerplate Outlook email, and a program to quickly tell if an institution's DEA license
    has expired.  I'm sure I can think of more as I get deeper into Flask.  I should probably also learn some jQuery/get
    back to JavaScript and figure out how to integrate that with Flask at some point to spice this gross little website up.
    Always something more to learn.

    Blogging is not really my style but it's extremely helpful as far as practicing and learning more programming
    concepts/technologies.  Sometimes I just feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQJGmjnc8LU" style="color: #FFCC00">Creed Bratton</a>.

    <p class="text">This is my simple, ugly blog.  I'm throwing small bits of
    HTML and CSS together to create some slapdash content for this thing.  The purpose of this
    whole enterprise is to get my feet wet with Python and web development, and hopefully have
    something presentable to show off when I'm all finished.  I'm currently a little more than
    a month into learning Python, and it's been closer to two months since I started to teach myself
    programming with any seriousness.<br><br>I'll be steadily adding content to this thing all summer.
    Next on the TODO is to create a write-up detailing my previous (mostly complete) project and
    general CSS stylings to make this site look a little less utilitarian.</p>
