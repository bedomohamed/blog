                    <b>Well, my Pi arrived last week.</b>  It was a snap to set everything up, which genuinely surprised me.
                    I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GGM0Y66/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this</a> starter kit from Amazon and complemented
                    it with a cheap <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWF5U0M/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">USB Hub</a> for the initial setup.  The SD card
                    came preloaded with <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a>, so all I had to do was slot the card in, power on the Pi, select Raspian, and wait.  I had a
                    fully usable Linux box in about 15 minutes.<br><br>
                    It's taken a little getting used to, but Linux isn't so scary.  I do miss the simplicity and consistency of Windows.  It's a little disconcerting when programs
                    and their documentation are sometimes abandoned, forcing your plans to unexpectedly evolve, but such is the Linux way, I suppose.<br><br>
                    I overestimated the Pi's hardware capabilities, so I had to find a new solution for my project.  That whole process will be the subject of the next part of my
                    writeup, but...<b>SPOILER</b> I solved the problem and came up with a working solution.  Now I'm just waiting for the final technological component to arrive, a
                    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IIZKU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">tiny LCD screen.</a>  Once that arrives and is properly configured
                    it'll be time to figure out how best to set this whole thing into a frame without it looking like amateur garbage.

                    <b>I'm well underway with my new project - </b> a Raspberry Pi powered digital picture frame.  The Python
                    side of things is pretty much complete, and you can read about the development process in my new
                    <a href="/piproject-part1">writeup</a>.<br><br>
                    The code's not quite ready for primetime, but it's very nearly there.  I'll keep working on it, but it'll
                    be difficult because my Raspberry Pi is being delivered <em>today</em>.  That means I'm in for a busy
                    couple of days as I try to get the little guy up and running and then try to master Linux at the same time.
                    I'll be sure to post my impressions later in the week.<br><br>

				<h2>Back At It</h2>
                <bd>June 2nd, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    <b>I'm back from a healthy week long vacation.</b>  It's been a busy three months since I started learning to program.  My day job keeps a pretty consistently hectic
                    pace and then adding as much programming learning as I could find time for on top of that meant that I was more than overdue for some time off.  One of the best strategies I've learned
                    when confronted with a really tricky programming problem is to simply walk away for a while.  This could mean literally walking away (I usually take Bacon on a walk) or just focusing
                    on something else.  The answer is usually much more apparent after you've taken your eyes off of it for a time and returned.<br><br>
                    I decided to take this approach with programming in general.  Nearly every minute of my free time had been soaked up by some technology or another since I started down this path in
                    early March and I was beginning to feel the earliest twinge of burnout, manifesting mainly in a lack of interest in starting another large project.  So I took a week vacation from both
                    work and programming.  It was a glorious week of video games, friends, and relaxation, and I returned from the break refreshed and with ideas for new projects.<br><br>
                    After my last post (nearly three weeks ago) I took a break from projects to just focus on my actual Python knowledge.  I've been maintaining a consistent regimen of daily practice problems
                    and I feel more confident every day, though there is of course still so much to learn.  Now, after my break, I'm ready for another big project and I've decided to start experimenting
                    with the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>!  I'll write up some more details on my specific application of the device this week, which might also serve as a
                    rough outline of the project for myself.  Of course, I'll be documenting the whole process here on my blog.  Right now, though, it's time for research!
