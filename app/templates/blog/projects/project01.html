                    <strong>Descent Into Evil</strong> is a text-based RPG that came about as I struggled to think
                    of a substantive first project.  Diving into programming is overwhelming, and I found it difficult to focus on one
                    thing when there is so much else that needed to be learned.
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> has you start a similar project with their
                    JavaScript track which gave me a solid starting point and I just ran with it.  I added features as I
                    thought of them until I considered the game mostly complete.  It's at a stage now where I can add more
                    content like additional weapons, armor, combat moves, monsters, etc, in a modular and intuitive way.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a fun project and gave me invaluable
                    experience in a number of ways, but mostly it taught me that transferring an idea from my brain into a workable piece
                    of software was a process that I could actually find rewarding and fun.
