                    A friend of mine was in the habit of grabbing images from reddit to use as his desktop wallpaper.
                    As I thought about him manually finding the links and downloading the images the idea for this app
                    came to me.
                    <br><br>
                    It's basically just a heavily modified version of the script I use to pull GIFs for GIF Party and
                    my Pi Display refactored to run live on a website and with a user-friendly front end.<br><br>
                    Check out the live site!
