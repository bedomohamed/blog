                    A friend of mine was in the habit of grabbing images from reddit to use as his desktop wallpaper manually.
                    As I thought about him manually finding the links and downloading the images the idea for this app
                    came to me.  It's basically just a modified version of the script I use to pull GIFs for GIF Party and
                    my Pi Display - but heavily modified.  And I built a front end for it, too!<br><br>
                    Check out the live site!
