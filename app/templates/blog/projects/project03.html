				<p>This project was great fun because it combined my love of hardware with my new found interest
                in programming.  The Raspberry Pi allows you to see your code manifest in the real world on an actual
                physical object, and that is really powerful.  This project isn't really as practical as a lot of
                Pi projects, but it <em>is</em> endlessly entertaining.  It turned out to have a much wider scope than I
                initailly thought, too, forcing me to step outside my comfort zone often and with great results.<br><br>
                The code for the project is linked above with my Github.  The project makes use of many technologies so
                the code is spread out amongst many different things like Python scripts and HTML websites, but it's all in there
                for the curious.<br><br>
                As of this writing the project isn't quite finished, so this page will likely change slightly.  Once
                it's 100%, completely, irrevocably finished I'm be refactoring my write-up into something much cleaner
                and more focused, so be on the lookout for that!
