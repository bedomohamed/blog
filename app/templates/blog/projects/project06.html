                    While this website certainly isn't the most complex piece of work on the internet, it's highly functional, looks good, and
                    does everything my clients needed it to do.  It was a great opportunity for me to get some experience working for someone.  I
                    learned a lot about expectations, professionalism, and working with deadlines.  I also put myself through a crash course on
                    SEO and focused heavily on a responsive design that would look good on almost every device.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not sure if I'll pursue web development as my ultimate career goal, but it was definitely an enjoyable and worthwhile
                    experience.

                    Note - the provided GitHub link is associated with the working demo site I maintained for my clients to view during development.
                    The final version's code does not differ in any substantial way.
