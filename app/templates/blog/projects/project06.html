                    I was fortunate enough to land an opportunity to do some real web development work.  I was approached by
                    the local school board and asked to produce a website for their upcoming re-election campaign.
                    <br><br>
                    It was incredibly valuable to get some experience working with actual clients.  I
                    learned a lot about expectations, professionalism, and working with deadlines.  I also put myself through a crash course on
                    SEO and focused on a responsive design that would look good on almost every device.
                    <br><br>
                    The provided GitHub link above is associated with the working demo site I maintained for my clients to view during development.
                    The final version's code does not differ in any substantial way.
