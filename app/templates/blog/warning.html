                    We all know the internet is a vast and strange domain.  Although I only scrape SFW subreddits and
                    actively try to remove questionable material, sometimes some weird stuff makes its way onto my
                    GIF display feed.  Please keep in mind that there are thousands of GIFs in rotation, and probably
                    less than 20 or so 'iffy' ones, so the chance of a really NSFW GIF popping up are slim, but definitely
                    there.

                    Beyond the occasional explicit NSFW GIF this whole project was built around my love
                    of the internet's sheer chaos and randomness, and as such there will be plenty of GIFs that might not
                    get you fired, but are still pretty disturbing nonetheless.  So while you might be enjoying a delicious
                    Kanye West GIF one moment, the next might bring you a guy falling off a building or something.<br><br>
                    You've been warned!
