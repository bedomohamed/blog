			    <p id="aboutme" ><b>I'm a 27 year old guy</b> living in Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti, Michigan.  I live with my girlfriend of 7 years
                and our dog Bacon - also of 7 years.  My parents are enjoying their retirement in my hometown of Sturgis, MI, and my two sisters (one twin, one a few years older)
                live in the Pacific Northwest.  I graduated from the University of Michigan with an English degree in 2011.
                English language and literature remains one of my passionate hobbies, but it was probably never something that I would
                turn into a career.  I remain truly grateful to my English program for the exposure to great works and research skills it granted me. <br><br><br>
                I currently work as a customer service rep for a manufacturer of research chemicals.  Not the most exciting sounding
                job, but it's with good people, a great atmosphere, and opportunities to practice and apply some
                programming.  It's comfortable and challenging and thankfully allows me to pay down my student debt. I started
                to dip my toe into some programming in early March 2014 through Codecademy and found that it was rewarding, satisfying, and actually fun.
                <br><br><br>I have many other hobbies that keep my free time occupied.  There are the standard
                movies, video games, and TV shows - I like a whole lot of them.  I also still enjoy reading novels of all
                kinds, though I definitely lean toward sci-fi.  I've played the guitar for something like ten years now, and I'll
                eventually link to some of my music here.  Computer hardware has always been a huge source of interest for me,
                and I've been building and maintaining systems for myself and my friends for many years now.  We all love a good
                tabletop game whenever possible.</p>
