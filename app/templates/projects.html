    <p class="blurb">My first real programming project.  It's a text-based RPG that came about as I struggled to think
    of a good first project.  Codecademy has you start something similar with their JavaScript track,
    so that gave me a little starting point and I just kinda ran with it.  I added features as I thought
    of them until I considered the game mostly complete.  It was really great fun and gave me invaluable
    experience in a number of ways, but mostly it taught me that transferring an idea from my brain
    to a workable piece of software was a process that I would find both satisfying and fun.</p>
