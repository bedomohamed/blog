        <p class="text">The text adventure was a lot of fun and very educational, but I needed to start applying my
            knowledge to something more practical.  I came up with the idea for a suite of very simple apps to help
            with a few mundane tasks at work.  I've got a great start on the project but it's far from finished.  Check
            the write-up for my ongoing progress with the project.

        <p class="text">My first real programming project.  It's a text-based RPG that came about as I struggled to think
        of a good first project.  Diving into programming is overwhelming, and it can be hard to focus and drill down on one
        thing when there is so much else that needs to be learned.  Codecademy has you start something similar with their
        JavaScript track, so that gave me a little starting point and I just kinda ran with it.  I added features as I
        thought of them until I considered the game mostly complete.  It's at a stage now where I can easily add more
        content like additional weapons, armor, combat moves, monsters, etc.  It was really great fun and gave me invaluable
        experience in a number of ways, but mostly it taught me that transferring an idea from my brain to a workable piece
        of software was a process that I would find both satisfying and fun.
