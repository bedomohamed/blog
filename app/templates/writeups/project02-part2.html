                <h2>The Templates</h2>
                <p>
                    Email templates are surely not the most complicated piece of software you can imagine, but they are incredible useful tools.  I'm writing this a little over a week since I've "completed" most of the template scripts
                    for my application and I've been making use of them as often and I can at work.  They definitely save me a lot of time and create a base level of consistency for many of the boilerplate emails the Customer Service
                    department has to send.  There are many, many ways a programmer can accomplish this same functionality, but Python and Flask work just fine for my purposes.  That's not to say I haven't run into my share of difficulties
                    along the way.

                <h2>Sending the Email</h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the actual input fields - HTML forms rendered by the <A href="https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-WTF</A> extension - is the subject of Miguel Grinberg's
                    <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iii-web-forms">third</a> article in his
                    <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask Mega Tutorial</a>.  As I was already familiar with grabbing the data field of an HTML form element from my
                    date checker app, after the forms were set up it was time to decide what method I was going to use to actually send the emails the template would be composing.  As you'd expect, there are quite a few options
                    to choose from.

                <h5>SMTP</h5>
                <p>
                    As I began my Google journey in search of some direction for this next step, the most prevalent suggestion was to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>.
                    SMTP is such a popular and preferred way of sending email in Python that there's an example implementation in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/email-examples.html">official documentation</a>.
                    Naturally I was pretty excited to have apparently arrived at my answer after so little searching effort.  However, I quickly discovered that SMTP wouldn't work for my program because of how my colleagues
                    and myself would be accessing it.<br><br>Creating a self-installing executable file for my application with <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> wasn't really an option because of my company's IT/administration rights policy,
                    so I needed the app to live somewhere it could be accessed even without a Python interpreter on the user's local machine.  This was a big factor in my decision to host CSTools on PythonAnywhere.  Since the
                    template script would be run on a different server than the local machine the user would have to enter their email authentication credentials every time they wanted to use one of my templates.  I
                    decided that this was a bit too clunky for what I had envisioned.
                </p>
                <h5>Mailto</h5>
                <p>
                    The next contender was trusty old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto">mailto</a>.  I remembered this guy from my first primitive forays into web development something like 15 years ago (on
                    my slick Tripod/GeoCities sites, no doubt).  This familiarity gave me pause - surely something a novice dev was familiar with <em>fifteen years ago</em> has been
                    deprecated and superseded by better techniques at this point.  I wasn't far off, as there are a few issues with mailto that lead many to call for its deprecation.  Briefly there are potential problems when the user does not have a default
                    mail program configured and also with security, as a mailto URL can openly display email addresses making them vulernable to scamming bots.<br><br>Beyond those major issues, the mailto method has a problem specific to my own
                    application.  Using mailto, I was able to cobble together some code that does pretty much exactly what I wanted it to:
                    <pre><code>
email = form.email.data

subject = "Cayman Chemical Backorder Notification %s" % form.po.data

body = "Hello %s,\n\nUnfortunately we need to inform you that one "\
        "of your items is currently not available.  Item # %s is " \
        "in production with an approximate lead time of %s.\n\nI " \
        "apologize for the inconvenience.  Please let me know if " \
        "you have any questions.\n\nHave a great day,\n\n" % \
        (form.name.data, form.item_number.data, form.lead_time.data)

link = "mailto:%s?subject=%s&body=%s" % (quote(email), quote(subject), quote(body))

return render_template("backorder.html",
                        title="Backorder Template",
                        link=link,
                        form=form)</code></pre><br><br>
                <p>
                    This code generates a mailto URL with the HTML-form supplied data populated into the appropriate spots.  This code is (very) simple, fast, and it works...there's just one problem.<br><br>Outlook, the
                    email client my company exclusively uses, does not make a distinction between the body of the email and the user's signature.  The signature is simply part of the body content.  When one of my
                    templates is generated using a mailto URL the user's signature won't be populated as the entirety of the body content was already specified with the mailto URL.  The user can easily click the
                    Outlook 2010 button to 'Add Signature', making this implementation still faster and easier than an SMTP implementation, but surely there's a way to get this program to do exactly what I want it to do, right?
                </p>
                <h5>The COM Interface</h5>
                <p>
                    The failure of the SMTP and mailto methods to give me the exact functionality I required led me down an even darker path of Python learning.  After many hours of scanning obscure now-defunct forums
                    I was pointed in the direction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a>.<br><br>The Component Object Model, as I understand it, was developed as a language-neutral
                    way of accessing the various methods and classes of common OS objects.  That all sounds like a truly noble endeavor that would make many devs' lives infinitely easier.  There was just one problem: the
                    implementation of the COM was left up to the developers of the individual components themselves with no codified system in place to guarantee consistency.  This meant in practice that finding documentation
                    for the specific piece of a program you're looking for can sometimes be an arcane task.<br><br>So there I was, trying to track down a way for Python to interact with the Outlook object
                    through the COM.  I had heard it said that one of the major steps on your path toward graduating from a "beginner" programmer is being faced with a problem for which the answer does not immediately appear on the first
                    couple pages of a Google search.  I can't verify that one way or the other, but I can tell you that it was a rough couple of days trying to wrap my head around the COM.  I was looking through the Microsoft COM
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop.outlook.application(v=office.14).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1">documentation</a> (which is written in C# and VBA, of course), posting
                    question threads on Reddit, and searching through the annals of StackOverflow.  Eventually I learned enough to piece together the following code:
                    <pre><code>
import win32com.client

olMailItem = 0x0
obj = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application")
newMail = obj.CreateItem(olMailItem)
newMail.GetInspector()
newMail.Subject = "Subject"
newMail.Body = "Actualemail"
newMail.To = "full@e.mail"
newMail.Attachments.Add("E:\zapp.doc")

newMail.Display()
                    </code></pre>
