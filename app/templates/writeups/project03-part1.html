                    For the past few weeks I struggled with finding a suitable idea for my next project.  After a much
                    needed vacation from work I was finally able to make a decision: focus my programming learning
                    on what I actually <em>enjoy</em> doing.  Given my hobbyist love for all things hardware I thought
                    the Raspberry Pi would be a great place to start - they're so small and awesome!  On the software
                    side I've been looking into web scraping for a little while now and so it just seemed natural to
                    try and integrate that type of program into the project.  I've decided on a digital
                    picture frame that pulls GIFs from various subreddits and displays them in a slideshow.  As my Pi
                    has not yet arrived, the first part of this writeup will focus on the scraping code.<br><br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been through a little over half of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity CS 101</a>
                    course - very highly recommended, by the way - so I am at least somewhat familiar with the concepts of
                    web scraping.  I'm also well aware that a script to do the majority of what I'm after very likely
                    already exists.  So then my first step was to find another coder's work that most closely maps to
                    my specific purpose for this project rather than waste time reinventing the wheel.<br><br>
                    I found <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2013/09/30/downloading-imgur-posts-linked-from-reddit-with-python/">a reddit image scraper</a>
                    written by Al Sweigart, who I was familiar with from the <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/">Invent With Python</a>
                    series of books (also highly recommended).  This code does its job well and runs almost perfectly
                    out of the box.  There were a few things I needed to tweak, however, and I'll detail them here.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>
                    Al's code is up on GitHub, located <a href='https://github.com/asweigart/imgur-hosted-reddit-posted-downloader/blob/master/imgur-hosted-reddit-posted-downloader.py'>here</a>.
                    The first thing I noticed when I fired up the script was that it would download
                    a few images just fine, and then hit an Index Error and stop.  My first task then was to debug the code.<br><br>
                    The line throwing the error was this one (line 83 in Al's Code):</p>
<pre><code data-language="python">imageUrl = soup.select('.image a')[0]['href']</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Now, when I first started this project I wasn't very familiar with <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> and how it operated,
                    so instead of deeply analyzing the problem and fixing it at the root I decided to just get the
                    script working with a quick and dirty try/except clause:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">try:
    imageUrl = soup.select('.image a')[0]['href']
except IndexError:
    continue
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This worked great because if an error was thrown by the line in question, the loop going through
                    each subreddit submission would simply skip that submission and move on to the next one.  The script
                    would execute just fine and fulfil its purpose, but this solution meant that some perfectly valid
                    submissions weren't being scraped.  It was time to start testing.  I used this small script to test
                    what exactly was being returned by line 83:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_source = requests.get('http://imgur.com/gallery/pa3Vot4').text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_source)
imageUrl = soup.select('.image a')[0]['href']

print image_url
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Running this script would spit out the HTML element associated with the given CSS class.  I could then
                    check that output against the source of the imgur page to find the discrepancy.  With a few glances at the
                    <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup documentation</a> and
                    more than a few trial-and-error runs I was able to narrow down the culprit of the error.<br><br>
                    It seems that imgur had slightly altered their HTML/CSS layout in the time since Al's code was authored (8
                    months ago), so the CSS selectors referenced by Al were no longer used in the same way.  Simply swapping
                    in the correct tags worked perfectly and allowed me to get rid of the clunky try/except clause.<br><br>
                    <strong>Edit:</strong> I've had to add back in the try/except clause.  There must be something
                    I'm missing with the way imgur formats these particular pages.  It's going to require looking at many
                    different pages and finding the discrepancy with my code.  I'll keep investigating and update this post
                    with my progress.
                </p>

                <h2>Modifying the Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I had fixed the one show-stopping bug in Al's script, it did exactly what it was intended to do -
                    whatever <em>Al</em> had written it for.  I wanted a few extra features from the script to fit
                    my own specific purpose, so I set about building in a few new functions.<br><br>
                    I wanted the script to log what it was doing.  It's both useful information and a good way
                    to further practice some Python I/O.  Since this script will eventually be running automatically
                    in the background at set intervals, I first wanted to log the time at which the script was run.  I
                    accomplished this by importing the datetime module and setting the current time to a variable formatted
                    how I wanted:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">time = str(datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p on %A, %B %d, %Y'))</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This particular strftime format will output the date like so: <strong>05:33 PM on Wednesday, June 04, 2014</strong>.
                    Very human readable.<br><br>
                    Next, since the Raspberry Pi has a somewhat limited amount of storage space I wanted to be able
                    to check the logs to find out how large my GIFs folder was becoming.  This task can be handled
                    by the OS module.  Since this operation involves a few steps, including a loop, I broke it off into
                    another function:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">def get_size(start_path='../imgur_scraper/gifs'):
    total_size = 0
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(start_path):
        for f in filenames:
            fp = os.path.join(dirpath, f)
            total_size += os.path.getsize(fp)
    return (total_size / 1024) / 1024.0
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here I'm using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk">os.walk</a> method.
                    <strong>os.walk</strong> is very handy because it can grab files and their attributes by 'walking' up or down the
                    directory tree from a designated starting point.  The <strong>os.path.join</strong> line is used to get
                    a full pathname to the file, which then has the <strong>getsize</strong> method called on it.
                    The size of each file (in bytes) is added to a running total, and when the walk is finished the
                    function returns the total divided by 1024, and then 1024 again - to get the size in MBs (a much
                    more human-friendly unit).<br><br>
                    I also wanted to have a simple count of the GIFs being added and the total number of images in my
                    GIFs folder.  At first I had a very clunky solution involving <em>*gasp*</em>  <strong>global variables</strong>, but
                    I quickly remembered that I had done this type of thing (modifying a constant variable from an
                    outside function) many times in my text adventure using class methods and attributes.  Here's what
                    I came up with for the scraper:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">class Gif(object):
    def __init__(self, count):
        self.count = count

    def counter(self):
        self.count += 1

# Instantiating Gif class
gif = Gif(0)
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This was much better than using a global variable.  I could call the <strong>gif.counter()</strong> method
                    every time a new gif was downloaded and then return the <strong>gif.count</strong> attribute whenever
                    I wanted to log it.  Here's what my final log function looks like:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">def log():
    time = str(datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p on %A, %B %d, %Y'))
    log_data = '\n\nAdded %d gifs at %s.' % (gif.count, time)
    number_of_gifs = len(os.listdir('../imgur_scraper/gifs'))
    folder_size = '\nGIF folder size: %d GIFs, approximately %d MBs.' % (number_of_gifs, get_size())
    with open('imgur_scraper_log.txt', 'a') as log_file:
        log_file.write(log_data)
        log_file.write(folder_size)
    print log_data, folder_size</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Now I have a very nice, very readable log file that looks like this:
                </p>
                    <pre><code>Added 18 gifs at 10:43 AM on Thursday, June 05, 2014.
GIF folder size: 51 GIFs, approximately 148 MBs.

Added 2 gifs at 11:26 AM on Thursday, June 05, 2014.
GIF folder size: 53 GIFs, approximately 163 MBs.</code></pre>
                <hr>
                <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
                <p>
                    One final step that I want to include here (because it was new to me) was converting the script into
                    a program that could be run without the command line and calling it with a simple batch file.  This meant encapsulating
                    the entire script into a "main" function, and adding the standard bit at the bottom:
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">if __name__ == '__main__':
    print '\n\n\nWhat subreddit would you like to scrape?'
    argument = raw_input('/r/ > ')
    scrape(argument)</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This way while I'm on my Windows development machine I can call the script very easily by running
                    the follow extremely simple <strong>scrape.bat</strong> file:
                </p>
<pre><code>e:\programming\projects\imgur_scraper\venv\scripts\python e:\programming\projects\imgur_scraper\imgur_scraper_windows.py %*\</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Now all I have to do is double click the batch file rather than using the CLI to navigate to my projects
                    folder, point to my virtualized Python interpreter, and run the script and its arguments, which can get quite tedious.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                That about covers the software side of things.  I'm pretty happy with the script I ended up with, though
                I'm sure I'll continue to tweak it as I see fit or as the project evolves.  My Raspberry Pi was delivered
                today while I was at work, so my next few days will be spent getting that thing up and running and attempting
                to familiarize myself with Linux.<br><br>
                Thanks for reading!
