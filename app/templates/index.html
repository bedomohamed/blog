<p class="text">Welcome to my (currently) hideous blog.  I'm frantically throwing some
HTML and CSS together to create some slapdash content for this thing.  The purpose of this
whole enterprise is to get my feet wet with Python and web development, and hopefully have
something presentable to show off when I'm all finished.  I'm currently a little more than
a month into learning Python, and closer to two months since I started to teach myself
programming in earnest.<br><br>I'll be steadily adding content to this thing all summer.
Next on the TODO is to create a write-up detailing my previous (mostly complete) project and
general CSS stylings to make this site look a little less utilitarian.</p>
